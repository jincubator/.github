# Solving and Arbitrage Research

## Overview

Here you'll find work on Solving, Arbitrage and Indexing using [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). As of July 2025 I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Development is ongoing and some repositories are private.

## Abstract

Liquidity Fragmentation and Capital Efficiency are areas that can be optimized in Blockchain protocols, with the emergence of Multiple L2 Chains and a shift towards intent-based architectures. There is a greater need than ever for a settlement layer to balance provided liquidity.

This is an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and multichain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may use the swappers locked funds for execution.

## Opinionated Sample Architecture

This is an opinionated architecture for an intent based solving protocol which facilitates single and mult-chain solving of intents. Intents can be solved on a single chain without provisioning up front capital as we arbiters can confirm mandates have been met by solvers at execution time, thus solvers may used the swappers locked funds for execution.

- Solving built in RUST leveraging [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview) from [Propellor Heads](https://www.propellerheads.xyz/) including
  - [tycho-sdk](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-protocol-sdk): For integrate DEXs and other onchain liquidity protocols
  - [tycho-indexer](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-indexer): a low-latency, reorg-aware stream of all attributes you need to simulate swaps over DEX and other on-chain liquidity built on [substreams](https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams)
  - [tycho-simulation](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-simulation): a Rust crate which allows simulating a set of supported protocols off-chain
  - [tycho-execution](https://github.com/propeller-heads/tycho-execution): a simple, ready-to-use tool that generates the necessary data to execute trades on multiple chains and DEX's
- Intent Management platform allowing optimized trading routes optimized by solvers who do not need to provide liquidity up front
  - [the-compact](https://github.com/Uniswap/the-compact): an ownerless ERC6909 contract that facilitates the voluntary formation (and, if necessary, eventual dissolution) of reusable resource locks.
  - [arbiters](https://github.com/Uniswap/arbiters): selects a claim method based on the type of Compact message signed by the sponsor and allocator and on the desired settlement behavior. To finalize a claim, some actor must call into the arbiter, which will act on the input and translate it into their preferred claim method. The arbiter then must call the derived claim method on The Compact to finalize the claim process.
  - [Tribunal](https://github.com/uniswap/tribunal): a framework for processing cross-chain swap settlements against PGA (priority gas auction) blockchains. It ensures that tokens are transferred according to the mandate specified by the originating sponsor and enforces that a single party is able to perform the settlement in the event of a dispute. _Note: currently working on enhancing the [EIP712 Signing](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) of the [mandates](https://github.com/uniswap/tribunal?tab=readme-ov-file#mandate-structure) so that the protocol can be used for solving on a single chain and multichain settlement._
  - Services that enable Solving and Arbitrage are drawn primarily from uniswap prototypes for [compactX](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx). _Note: it would be good to develop the majority of these in Rust and leverage Tycho's indexing and execution services_
    - [callibrator](https://github.com/Uniswap/Calibrator): An intent parameterization service, demo is [here](https://calibrat0r.com/). _Note: This will need to incorprate/integrate [mandates](https://github.com/uniswap/tribunal?tab=readme-ov-file#mandate-structure) as we build a solution for solving._
    - [v4-router](https://github.com/jincubator/v4-router): a simple and optimized router for swapping on Uniswap V4. _Note: Currently working on integrating intents into this management into this codebase and integrating this with an optimized smart order router._
    - [autocator](https://github.com/uniswap/autocator): A server-based allocator for The Compact that leverages protocol signatures and transactions for authentication, API reference is [here](https://autocator.org/).
    - [smallocator](https://github.com/Uniswap/Smallocator): Similar to autocator with smart contract support via EIP-4361 session authentication and signing EIP-712 Compact messages.
    - [Fillanthropist](https://github.com/Uniswap/Fillanthropist): receiving and filling broadcasted cross-chain swap intents, demo is [here](https://fillanthropist.org/). _Note: This infrastructure can be replaced by solver technology built on tycho as well as an update dissemination approach (see repo below) which can leverage tycho indexing._
    - [disseminator](https://github.com/Uniswap/disseminator): A TypeScript WebSocket server implementation that broadcasts messages to both HTTP endpoints and WebSocket clients. The server validates incoming messages using Zod schemas and ensures proper message delivery to all connected clients. _Note: Design work still needs to be done as to the most efficient way to store and transmit detailed intent and mandate information_
  - Frontend would include swapping and also liquidity provisioning and optimized Yield strategies for Liquidity Providers two inspirational repositories are
    - [compactX](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx): a proof-of-concept, React-based web interface for performing cross-chain swaps.
    - [YOLO Protocol](https://yolo-demo-ui-hackathon-chainlink-ch.vercel.app/): A Demo app developed for a hackathon by [YOLO Protocol](https://linktr.ee/yolo.protocol) which includes a dashboard for Liquidity Providers to manage their positions.
   
## Uniswap V4 Hook Integration - WIP

This section documents design work to be done for enhancing Uniswap V4 through the use of hooks for better price discovery, swapping, and solver execution.

It leverages [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho/overview), Intents using [ERC-7683](https://www.erc7683.org/spec), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), [Compactx](https://github.com/uniswap/compactx) and [Uniswap V4 Hooks](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview). As of July 2025 I use [jincubator](https://github.com/jincubator) for research and development of prototypes.
